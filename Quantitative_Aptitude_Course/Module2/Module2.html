    </ul>

    <h2>2.1 Percentages: Foundation of Proportional Reasoning</h2>
    <p>A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" means "per hundred." Percentages provide a standardized way to compare proportions and changes, making them essential in finance, statistics, and everyday decision-making.</p>

    <h3>Basic Percentage Calculations</h3>
    <p><strong>Converting Fractions to Percentages:</strong> Multiply the fraction by 100. Example: 3/4 = (3/4) × 100 = 75%</p>

    <p><strong>Converting Percentages to Fractions:</strong> Divide by 100 and simplify. Example: 60% = 60/100 = 3/5</p>

    <p><strong>Finding Percentage of a Number:</strong> Multiply the number by the percentage (as a decimal or fraction). Example: 25% of 80 = (25/100) × 80 = 20</p>

    <p><strong>Finding What Percentage One Number is of Another:</strong> Divide the first number by the second and multiply by 100. Example: What percent is 15 of 60? → (15/60) × 100 = 25%</p>

    <h3>Percentage Increase and Decrease</h3>
    <p><strong>Percentage Increase:</strong> If a value increases from A to B, the percentage increase = [(B - A) / A] × 100</p>

    <p>Example: If a price increases from $50 to $60, percentage increase = [(60 - 50) / 50] × 100 = 20%</p>

    <p><strong>Percentage Decrease:</strong> If a value decreases from A to B, the percentage decrease = [(A - B) / A] × 100</p>

    <p>Example: If a price decreases from $80 to $64, percentage decrease = [(80 - 64) / 80] × 100 = 20%</p>

    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> A 20% increase followed by a 20% decrease does NOT return to the original value. If original = 100, after 20% increase = 120, after 20% decrease from 120 = 96 (net 4% decrease).</p>

    <h3>Successive Percentage Changes</h3>
    <p>When multiple percentage changes are applied successively, they compound. The formula for two successive changes of a% and b% is:</p>

    <p>Net change = a + b + (ab/100)%</p>

    <p>Example: A 10% increase followed by a 20% increase → Net change = 10 + 20 + (10×20/100) = 10 + 20 + 2 = 32% increase</p>

    <p>For a decrease, use negative values. Example: 20% increase followed by 10% decrease → Net change = 20 + (-10) + (20×(-10)/100) = 20 - 10 - 2 = 8% increase</p>

    <h2>2.2 Ratio and Proportion</h2>
    <p>A ratio is a comparison of two quantities by division. If two quantities A and B are in the ratio m:n, it means A/B = m/n, or A = (m/n) × B.</p>

    <h3>Ratio Basics</h3>
    <p><strong>Simplifying Ratios:</strong> Divide both terms by their HCF. Example: 24:36 = 2:3 (dividing by HCF 12)</p>

    <p><strong>Equivalent Ratios:</strong> Multiplying or dividing both terms by the same number gives equivalent ratios. Example: 2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9</p>

    <p><strong>Comparing Ratios:</strong> Convert to fractions with common denominators or cross-multiply. Example: Which is greater, 3:4 or 5:7? → 3/4 = 21/28, 5/7 = 20/28, so 3:4 is greater.</p>

    <p><strong>Compound Ratios:</strong> If A:B = m:n and B:C = p:q, then A:B:C = mp:np:nq. Example: If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, then A:B:C = 8:12:15</p>

    <h3>Direct and Inverse Proportion</h3>
    <p><strong>Direct Proportion:</strong> Two quantities are directly proportional if an increase in one causes a proportional increase in the other. If A ∝ B, then A/B = constant, or A₁/B₁ = A₂/B₂.</p>

    <p>Example: If 5 workers complete a task in 10 days, how many days will 10 workers take (assuming same efficiency)? This is inverse proportion: 5 × 10 = 10 × x → x = 5 days</p>

    <p><strong>Inverse Proportion:</strong> Two quantities are inversely proportional if an increase in one causes a proportional decrease in the other. If A ∝ 1/B, then A × B = constant, or A₁ × B₁ = A₂ × B₂.</p>

    <h3>Partnership Problems</h3>
    <p>In partnership problems, profit or loss is divided among partners in the ratio of their investments, considering both capital and time period.</p>

    <p><strong>Simple Partnership:</strong> When investments are for the same time period, profit is divided in the ratio of investments. Example: A invests $3000, B invests $5000. Profit ratio = 3:5</p>

    <p><strong>Compound Partnership:</strong> When investments are for different time periods, profit is divided in the ratio of (Capital × Time). Example: A invests $4000 for 6 months, B invests $6000 for 4 months. Profit ratio = (4000×6):(6000×4) = 24000:24000 = 1:1</p>

    <h2>2.3 Profit, Loss, and Discount</h2>
    <p>These concepts form the foundation of business mathematics and are essential for understanding commercial transactions.</p>

    <h3>Fundamental Concepts</h3>
    <p><strong>Cost Price (CP):</strong> The price at which an article is purchased or manufactured.</p>

    <p><strong>Selling Price (SP):</strong> The price at which an article is sold.</p>

    <p><strong>Profit:</strong> When SP > CP, Profit = SP - CP</p>

    <p><strong>Loss:</strong> When CP > SP, Loss = CP - SP</p>

    <p><strong>Profit Percentage:</strong> (Profit / CP) × 100</p>

    <p><strong>Loss Percentage:</strong> (Loss / CP) × 100</p>

    <h3>Key Formulas</h3>
    <p>SP = CP + Profit = CP + (Profit% × CP / 100) = CP(1 + Profit%/100)</p>

    <p>SP = CP - Loss = CP - (Loss% × CP / 100) = CP(1 - Loss%/100)</p>

    <p>CP = SP / (1 + Profit%/100) when profit is made</p>

    <p>CP = SP / (1 - Loss%/100) when loss is incurred</p>

    <h3>Marked Price and Discount</h3>
    <p><strong>Marked Price (MP):</strong> The price marked on an article (list price) before any discount.</p>

    <p><strong>Discount:</strong> The reduction offered on the marked price. Discount = MP - SP</p>

    <p><strong>Discount Percentage:</strong> (Discount / MP) × 100</p>

    <p>SP = MP - Discount = MP(1 - Discount%/100)</p>

    <h3>Successive Discounts</h3>
    <p>When multiple discounts are applied successively, use the successive percentage formula. For discounts of a% and b%:</p>

    <p>Net discount = a + b - (ab/100)%</p>

    <p>Example: Successive discounts of 20% and 10% → Net discount = 20 + 10 - (20×10/100) = 30 - 2 = 28%</p>

    <p>Alternatively, apply discounts sequentially: After 20% discount, price = 0.8 × MP. After additional 10% discount, price = 0.9 × 0.8 × MP = 0.72 × MP (28% total discount)</p>

    <h2>2.4 Simple and Compound Interest</h2>
    <p>Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the return on lending/investing money. Understanding interest calculations is crucial for financial literacy and problem-solving.</p>

    <h3>Simple Interest (SI)</h3>
    <p>Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount throughout the entire period.</p>

    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> SI = (P × R × T) / 100</p>

    <p>Where: P = Principal (initial amount), R = Rate of interest per annum (%), T = Time period (years)</p>

    <p><strong>Amount:</strong> A = P + SI = P + (P × R × T / 100) = P(1 + RT/100)</p>

    <p>Example: Principal = $1000, Rate = 5% per annum, Time = 3 years → SI = (1000 × 5 × 3) / 100 = $150, Amount = $1150</p>

    <h3>Compound Interest (CI)</h3>
    <p>Compound interest is calculated on the principal plus accumulated interest from previous periods. Interest earns interest.</p>

    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> A = P(1 + R/100)^T</p>

    <p>CI = A - P = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]</p>

    <p>Example: Principal = $1000, Rate = 5% per annum compounded annually, Time = 3 years → A = 1000(1.05)³ = 1000 × 1.157625 = $1157.63, CI = $157.63</p>

    <h3>Compounding Frequency</h3>
    <p>Interest can be compounded at different frequencies:</p>

    <p><strong>Annually:</strong> A = P(1 + R/100)^T</p>

    <p><strong>Semi-annually:</strong> A = P(1 + R/200)^(2T)</p>

    <p><strong>Quarterly:</strong> A = P(1 + R/400)^(4T)</p>

    <p><strong>Monthly:</strong> A = P(1 + R/1200)^(12T)</p>

    <h3>Difference Between SI and CI</h3>
    <p>For the same principal, rate, and time, CI > SI (except for the first period where they're equal).</p>

    <p>The difference increases with time and rate. For 2 years: CI - SI = P(R/100)²</p>

    <p>For 3 years: CI - SI = P(R/100)²(3 + R/100)</p>
