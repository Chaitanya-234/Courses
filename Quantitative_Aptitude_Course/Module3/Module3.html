    <h2>3.1 Algebra: The Language of Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Algebra uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. It provides a powerful framework for solving problems systematically and generalizing mathematical relationships.</p>

    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p>A linear equation in one variable has the form ax + b = 0, where a ≠ 0. The solution is x = -b/a.</p>

    <p><strong>Solving Linear Equations:</strong> Isolate the variable by performing the same operations on both sides. Example: 3x + 7 = 22 → 3x = 15 → x = 5</p>

    <p><strong>Linear Equations in Two Variables:</strong> Equations like 2x + 3y = 12 have infinitely many solutions. Two such equations form a system that can be solved using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Substitution Method:</strong> Solve one equation for one variable, substitute into the other</li>
        <li><strong>Elimination Method:</strong> Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Multiplication Method:</strong> For equations a₁x + b₁y = c₁ and a₂x + b₂y = c₂</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quadratic Equations</h3>
    <p>A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0. Solutions can be found using:</p>

    <p><strong>Factorization:</strong> Express as (px + q)(rx + s) = 0, then px + q = 0 or rx + s = 0</p>

    <p><strong>Quadratic Formula:</strong> x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a</p>

    <p><strong>Discriminant (D = b² - 4ac):</strong> Determines nature of roots:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>D > 0: Two distinct real roots</li>
        <li>D = 0: Two equal real roots (one repeated root)</li>
        <li>D < 0: No real roots (complex roots)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Polynomials</h3>
    <p>A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients involving only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.</p>

    <p><strong>Degree:</strong> The highest power of the variable. Example: 3x⁴ + 2x² - 5x + 7 has degree 4</p>

    <p><strong>Operations:</strong> Polynomials can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided (with remainder)</p>

    <h3>Inequalities</h3>
    <p>Inequalities use symbols <, >, ≤, ≥ to compare expressions. Solving inequalities follows similar rules to equations, with one critical exception: multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.</p>

    <p>Example: -2x + 6 > 10 → -2x > 4 → x < -2 (sign reversed when dividing by -2)</p>

    <h3>Basic Algebraic Identities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²</li>
        <li>(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²</li>
        <li>a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)</li>
        <li>(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³</li>
        <li>(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³</li>
        <li>a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)</li>
        <li>a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.2 Time and Work</h2>
    <p>Time and work problems involve calculating how long it takes individuals or groups to complete tasks, considering their work rates and efficiencies.</p>

    <h3>Fundamental Concepts</h3>
    <p><strong>Work Rate:</strong> If a person can complete a work in n days, their work rate is 1/n of the work per day.</p>

    <p><strong>Combined Work:</strong> If A can do work in a days and B can do it in b days, working together they complete (1/a + 1/b) of the work per day. Time taken together = 1 / (1/a + 1/b) = ab/(a+b) days</p>

    <p>Example: A can complete work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Together: 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = 5/30 = 1/6 per day. Time = 6 days</p>

    <h3>Work and Wages</h3>
    <p>Wages are distributed in the ratio of work done. If A and B work together, their wage ratio equals their work ratio, which equals the ratio of (Efficiency × Time).</p>

    <p>Example: A works for 6 days, B for 8 days. A's efficiency is twice B's. Work ratio = (2×6):(1×8) = 12:8 = 3:2. If total wage is $500, A gets $300, B gets $200.</p>

    <h3>Pipes and Cisterns</h3>
    <p>Similar to time-work problems, but involving filling or emptying tanks. Inlet pipes fill (positive work), outlet pipes empty (negative work).</p>

    <p>Example: Pipe A fills tank in 12 hours, Pipe B empties in 18 hours. Net rate = 1/12 - 1/18 = 3/36 - 2/36 = 1/36 per hour. Time to fill = 36 hours</p>

    <h3>Efficiency Concepts</h3>
    <p>Efficiency is the rate of work. If A is twice as efficient as B, A completes work in half the time. Efficiency is inversely proportional to time: E₁/E₂ = T₂/T₁</p>

    <h2>3.3 Time, Speed, and Distance</h2>
    <p>These problems involve motion and are based on the fundamental relationship: Distance = Speed × Time</p>

    <h3>Basic Formulas</h3>
    <p>Distance = Speed × Time</p>
    <p>Speed = Distance / Time</p>
    <p>Time = Distance / Speed</p>

    <p><strong>Unit Conversions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>km/hr to m/s: Multiply by 5/18</li>
        <li>m/s to km/hr: Multiply by 18/5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: 72 km/hr = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s</p>

    <h3>Average Speed</h3>
    <p>Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Average speed is NOT the average of speeds. If equal distances are covered at speeds s₁ and s₂, average speed = 2s₁s₂/(s₁+s₂) (harmonic mean)</p>

    <p>Example: A person travels 60 km at 30 km/hr and returns at 20 km/hr. Average speed = 2×30×20/(30+20) = 1200/50 = 24 km/hr</p>

    <h3>Relative Speed</h3>
    <p><strong>Same Direction:</strong> Relative speed = |Speed₁ - Speed₂|</p>

    <p><strong>Opposite Direction:</strong> Relative speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂</p>

    <p>Example: Two trains traveling at 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr in opposite directions have relative speed = 100 km/hr</p>

    <h3>Trains Problems</h3>
    <p>When a train crosses a stationary object (pole, person), distance = length of train</p>

    <p>When a train crosses a platform/bridge, distance = length of train + length of platform/bridge</p>

    <p>When two trains cross each other, distance = sum of their lengths, speed = relative speed</p>

    <p>Example: A 200m train crosses a 300m platform in 25 seconds. Speed = (200+300)/25 = 20 m/s = 72 km/hr</p>

    <h3>Boats and Streams</h3>
    <p><strong>Downstream:</strong> Boat moves with current. Effective speed = Speed of boat + Speed of stream</p>

    <p><strong>Upstream:</strong> Boat moves against current. Effective speed = Speed of boat - Speed of stream</p>

    <p><strong>Formulas:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed of boat in still water = (Downstream speed + Upstream speed) / 2</li>
        <li>Speed of stream = (Downstream speed - Upstream speed) / 2</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: Boat travels 20 km downstream in 2 hours, returns in 4 hours. Downstream speed = 10 km/hr, Upstream speed = 5 km/hr. Boat speed = (10+5)/2 = 7.5 km/hr, Stream speed = (10-5)/2 = 2.5 km/hr</p>
