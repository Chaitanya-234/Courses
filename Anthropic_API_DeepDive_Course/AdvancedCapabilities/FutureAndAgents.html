    <h1>Future Trends and Agents</h1>

    <h2>| Concept Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The field of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly evolving beyond simple text completion and chatbots into the realm of <strong>autonomous agents</strong>. This module explores how Claude can power sophisticated agentic workflows, execute complex multi-step tasks, and interact with external systems more effectively. We also discuss the ethical considerations of deploying such powerful systems.
    </p>

    <h2>| Detailed Explanation: Agentic Workflows</h2>
    <p>
        An "agent" is an AI system designed to achieve a goal autonomously by planning, executing actions (using tools), and refining its approach based on feedback.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> The agent breaks down a high-level goal (e.g., "Plan a travel itinerary") into smaller, manageable steps (Find flights -> Check hotels -> Validate budget).</li>
        <li><strong>Tool Use as Action:</strong> Instead of just answering questions, the agent calls APIs (tools) to retrieve real-time data or perform actions (e.g., booking a ticket).</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Advanced agents can review their own outputs or intermediate steps to catch errors before presenting the final result.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>| Technical Breakdown: Computer Use (Beta)</h2>
    <p>
        A cutting-edge capability recently introduced is <strong>Computer Use</strong>. This allows Claude to interact with a computer interface directly—viewing the screen via screenshots, moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text—just like a human user. This opens up possibilities for automating tasks in legacy software that lacks APIs. However, this powerful feature comes with significant responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>| Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <p>
        As AI agents become more autonomous, ethical guidelines become critical.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop:</strong> For high-stakes actions (financial transactions, modifying critical data), a human approval step is often necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Users should always know they are interacting with an AI agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Guardrails:</strong> Robust system prompts and safety layers (as discussed in Module 1) must be in place to prevent agents from executing harmful commands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>| Real-World Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer Support Agents:</strong> Autonomous agents that can resolve complex tickets by accessing internal databases and issuing refunds within policy limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis Pipelines:</strong> Agents that can write and execute Python code to analyze datasets, generate charts, and summarize findings without human intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> coding assistants that can not only write code but also run tests, debug errors, and commit changes to a repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>| Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Agents extend LLMs:</strong> Moving from chat to action-oriented workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Planning & Reflection:</strong> Key components of a successful agent architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Use:</strong> A frontier capability enabling direct GUI interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics First:</strong> Responsible deployment requires careful oversight and safety measures.</li>
    </ul>
